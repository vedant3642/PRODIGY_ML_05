# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation
This project implements a food recognition and calorie estimation model that identifies food items from images and predicts their approximate calorie content. It combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to help users track their dietary intake and make informed nutritional choices.
This project uses deep learning to classify food images and estimate their caloric values. It enables applications such as diet tracking, health monitoring, and AI-powered meal logging.

## üîç Features:
Food image classification using CNN

Calorie estimation using regression model or lookup tables

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Optional: Real-time recognition using webcam or mobile camera
