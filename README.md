# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation
This project implements a food recognition and calorie estimation model that identifies food items from images and predicts their approximate calorie content. It combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to help users track their dietary intake and make informed nutritional choices.
This project uses deep learning to classify food images and estimate their caloric values. It enables applications such as diet tracking, health monitoring, and AI-powered meal logging.
